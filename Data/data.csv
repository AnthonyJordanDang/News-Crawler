1,,"U.S. President Donald Trump is planning to declare a national emergency to build his promised wall on the Mexican border, circumventing Congress and again testing the constitutional limits of his executive power.Update: ‘I’m going to be signing a national emergency’ to fund U.S-Mexico border wall, Trump declaresThe move will allow Mr. Trump to avoid another government shutdown this week without backing down on his foundational campaign pledge, but is likely to set off a contentious court battle.Mr. Trump has been demanding US$5.7-billion for the wall from Congress since December as part of a larger government spending bill. Legislators this week reached a compromise that would provide only US$1.375-billion. The bill must be signed into law by Friday to keep the government from running out of funds and suspending some operations.On Thursday afternoon, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell burst onto the floor of the chamber and interrupted debate to announce that Mr. Trump would approve the legislation – and simultaneously issue an emergency declaration to get the rest of the money.“I had an opportunity to speak with President Trump and he … has indicated he’s prepared to sign the bill. He will also be issuing a national emergency declaration at the same time,” Mr. McConnell said. “I’m going to support the national emergency declaration.”Both the Senate and House passed the bill, sending it to Mr. Trump. The President scheduled an event to address “the crisis on our southern border” for 10 a.m. ET Friday in the White House Rose Garden.Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives accused Mr. Trump of “making an end-run around Congress” and said launching a court challenge was “an option” she is reviewing.“It’s not an emergency what’s happening at the border,” she told reporters on Capitol Hill. “It’s a humanitarian challenge.”Mr. Trump’s declaration will be governed by the National Emergencies Act. Once he proclaims an emergency at the border, he will have the ability to invoke more than 100 specific special powers to deal with it, including provisions that allow him to divert funds from the Defense Department’s budget to fund special military construction.A court challenge would turn on the premise that Mr. Trump is abusing his authority by using the act for something it was not intended for. Previous emergency declarations have involved specific threats from hostile powers: the 1979 hostage-taking of Americans following the Iranian Revolution, for instance, or the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.But the law is open-ended enough that it could be a difficult case for a court to decide.“There’s nothing in the act itself that really defines what an emergency is. The constraints on using it are more norms than anything within the law,” said Julie Novkov, a political scientist and constitutional law expert with the State University of New York at Albany.Prof. Novkov said it’s most likely that a challenge would therefore look at the specific ways in which Mr. Trump uses his authority to get the wall built – classifying the wall as military construction, for instance – and whether these violate the constitutional separation of powers between the President and Congress.Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University contends that the purpose of emergency powers is to allow the President to address situations that require a faster response than Congress can muster. But in the case of the Mexican border, Congress has considered the situation and expressly opted not to take the action Mr. Trump wants.“When the President invents an emergency in order to fund a project that Congress has very explicitly declined to fund, that’s an effort to undermine the constitutional allocation of powers,” she said in a question-and-answer on the Brennan Center’s website.Mr. Trump has faced other court challenges to the constitutionality of his actions. Most notably, his attempts to ban people from some Muslim-majority countries from travelling to the U.S. were repeatedly struck down by judges. Ultimately, the Supreme Court ruled that a limited version of the ban was constitutional.Mr. Trump promised during the campaign to build a wall along 1,600 to 3,200 kilometres of the border and have Mexico pay for it. But Mexico has adamantly refused to hand over any money and Congress has provided enough funding for less than 300 kilometres of wall.Congress has the ability, under the act, to overrule a presidential declaration. But this would require a two-thirds majority and congressional Republicans have consistently shied away from any action that concretely challenges Mr. Trump.Still, some GOP senators said they were deeply uneasy with the President’s decision – not least because they feared it would set a precedent for a future Democratic president to unilaterally impose policies Republicans dislike, such as cuts to carbon emissions.“No crisis justifies violating the Constitution,” said Florida Senator Marco Rubio. “Today’s national emergency is border security. But a future president may use this exact same tactic to impose the Green New Deal.”",2019-02-15T01:31:48Z,The Globe And Mail,Trump set to declare national emergency in bid to fund border wall - The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/us-politics/article-trump-to-sign-spending-bill-as-he-moves-to-declare-national-emergency/
2,Jaclyn Gallucci,"Donald Trump’s former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen is set to tell Congress that the president is a liar who repeatedly made false statements about his wealth and his efforts to build a luxury tower in Moscow while running for office, according to a copy of his prepared remarks.
Cohen is also making public copies of the checks he received that he and federal prosecutors in Manhattan have said are reimbursement for hush money he paid to silence adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, who claimed an extramarital affair with Trump. At least one of the checks, dated August 1, 2017, was personally signed by Trump.
Cohen has pleaded guilty to charges of illegal campaign contributions related to the payments.


Cohen is also planning to tell the House Oversight and Reform Committee about alleged misdeeds by his former boss, claiming that Trump knew during the 2016 presidential election that his ally Roger Stone was talking to Julian Assange of WikiLeaks about a release of hacked Democratic National Committee emails.
He also said he’s planning to provide additional documentary evidence to back up some of his claims.
“I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is,” Cohen intends to tell the committee at a public hearing on Wednesday, about the man who he once said he’d take a bullet for. “He is a racist. He is a con man. He is a cheat,” Cohen said in the prepared testimony.
Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to nine felonies, including lying to Congress, and is headed to prison, also is planning to tell the committee that Trump “did not directly tell me to lie to Congress” about the timing of talks to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.

“That’s not how he operates,” Cohen said in the prepared remarks.
Campaign Conversations
But Cohen asserts that in conversations with Trump during the 2016 campaign, “at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there’s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing.”
“In his way, he was telling me to lie,” he wrote.
“I lied to Congress about when Mr. Trump stopped negotiating the Moscow Tower project in Russia. I stated that we stopped negotiating in January 2016,” Cohen wrote in his statement. “That was false — our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign.”
Cohen, in his testimony, says he has first-hand knowledge of — and even some documentary evidence for — a number of questionable and even potentially illegal Trump activities.


One of the biggest accusations involves the 2016 WikiLeaks release.
Telephone Call
“He was a presidential candidate who knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails,” Cohen plans to say, recalling a telephone call to Trump from Stone when he was in the room that was put on speaker.
“Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign,” Cohen writes. “Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of “wouldn’t that be great.”
Cohen plans to provide the committee a check he says was written from the president’s personal bank account, after he took office, “to reimburse me for the hush money payments I made to cover up his affair with an adult film star and prevent damage to his campaign.”


So, too, is he planning to provide the committee three years of Trump’s financial statements, from 2011-2013, which he gave to Deutsche Bank to inquire about a loan to buy the Buffalo Bills.
Inflated, Deflated
Cohen intends to testify that, “It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.”
He described his role in the Trump circle as “always stay on message. Always defend. It monopolized my life.”
“Mr. Trump is an enigma. He is complicated, as am I,” Cohen said. “He has both good and bad, as do we all. But the bad far outweighs the good, and since taking office, he has become the worst version of himself. He is capable of behaving kindly, but he is not kind. He is capable of committing acts of generosity, but he is not generous. He is capable of being loyal, but he is fundamentally disloyal.”


Trump’s Brand
Cohen wrote that his former boss never expected to win the Republican nomination in 2016, let alone the general election. He said Trump, a first-time candidate, “ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great. He had no desire or intention to lead this nation — only to market himself and to build his wealth and power. Mr. Trump would often say, this campaign was going to be the ‘greatest infomercial in political history’.”
Cohen testified behind closed doors before the Senate Intelligence Committee for hours on Tuesday and will do the same on Thursday before the House Intelligence panel. Questions will focus in part on his role in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.
White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement on Tuesday that “it’s laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies.”


Sharp Debate
His appearance has generated sharp debate along party lines.
“Obviously, he has a story to tell and he wants to tell it. And I want him to tell it,” said Democrat Gerald Connolly, a Virginia Democrat and the chairman of the Oversight subcommittee on government operations. When it comes to Trump’s businesses and Trump personally, Connolly said, “This is not just some marginal figure.”
But Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the Oversight panel’s top Republican, says there’s nothing to be gained.
“That’s right,” Jordan said in a tweet. “Oversight Dems first big witness: a guy going to prison in two months for LYING TO CONGRESS.”",2019-02-27T15:21:08Z,Fortune,Michael Cohen Calls Donald Trump a Liar in Prepared Testimony,http://fortune.com/2019/02/27/michael-cohen-prepared-testimony/
3,Ashley Collman,"Michael Cohen testified before the House oversight committee in Washington, DC, on Wednesday.      In his opening statement, the former longtime attorney for President Donald Trump spoke briefly about the relationship between Trump and Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.      Cohen said Trump ""frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr. had the worst judgment of anyone in the world.""     Follow along with our live blog of the hearing here. President Donald Trump has not always spoken highly of his eldest son, according to his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen.  Cohen spoke about the relationship between the president and Donald Trump Jr. as he testified before the House oversight committee on Wednesday. In his opening statement, Cohen said he'd been asked whether he was aware of the meeting the younger Trump had with a Russian operative at Trump Tower ahead of the 2016 presidential election.  While he said he didn't have evidence of the meeting, he did have ""his suspicions"" because of a ""peculiar"" incident he said he witnessed in Trump's office in early June 2016. He said he watched the younger Trump enter a room and walk behind his father's desk, which was unusual, and then say in a low voice that a meeting was ""all set.""  ""What struck me as I looked back and thought about that exchange between Don Jr. and his father was, first, that Mr. Trump had frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr. had the worst judgment of anyone in the world,"" Cohen said.  He added: ""And also, that Don Jr. would never set up any meeting of any significance alone — and certainly not without checking with his father.""

This undated photo provided by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's Phoenix Division shows a closeup of the fentanyl-laced sky blue pills known on the street as ""Mexican oxy."" Smuggled in from Mexico, these mimic the prescription drug oxycodone. Law enforcement officers in the U.S. Southwest say they have also seen fentanyl-laced pills mimicking Vicodin pain medicine and Xanax anti-anxiety tablets, as well as fentanyl powder to mix with heroin for an extra kick. Officers say that because the tablets are designed to look like prescription medicine, consumers often don't know they are swallowing fentanyl. And because they are made without any kind of quality control, taking them is like Russian roulette because the amount of fentanyl in each can vary widely.

Sign in to CommentPresident Donald Trump’s decision to extend the deadline for increasing tariffs on Chinese goods defuses one of the biggest risks hanging over global trade, investment and sentiment.I am pleased to report that the U.S. has made substantial progress in our trade talks with China on important structural issues including intellectual property protection, technology transfer, agriculture, services, currency, and many other issues. As a result of these very……— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2019….productive talks, I will be delaying the U.S. increase in tariffs now scheduled for March 1. Assuming both sides make additional progress, we will be planning a Summit for President Xi and myself, at Mar-a-Lago, to conclude an agreement. A very good weekend for U.S. & China!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2019That spurred a risk-on rally in Asia on Monday, even as a commentary from Xinhua News Agency cautioned that the talks may face “new uncertainties.”The U.S.-China dispute is just one of a lengthening worry list that threatens to dent global growth. Here’s a look at why the bears won’t be hibernating just yet.AutosThe U.S. president is considering whether to impose levies on imported vehicles on the basis they are a threat to national security. Such a move would hurt not just the U.S. economy, but big manufacturing ones including Germany, Japan and South Korea too. Higher U.S. tariffs and retaliatory actions could jeopardize about US$500 billion of trade flows, accounting for 2.8 per cent of 2017 global imports, according to Moody’s Investors Service Ltd.

Much will depend on how durable the trade truce is, given the breadth of concerns that the U.S. has regarding China’s industrial and economic policies.“I don’t see the outlook for business investment globally improving markedly until we see more concrete plans for resolving the various issues between the U.S. and China,” said Tuuli McCully, head of Asia-Pacific economics at Scotiabank in Singapore.FedWhile Federal Reserve policy makers see 2019 marking the end of their balance sheet run-off, it may not mean they are done raising interest rates.

8,"Analysis by Chris Cillizza, CNN Editor-at-large","Breaking NewsHow Maine's former governor became a Trump emoluments poster boyAnalysis by Chris Cillizza, CNN Editor-at-largeUpdated 10:25 AM ET, Tue February 19, 2019 Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN)Former Maine Gov. Paul LePage was an early and enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump's presidential bid in 2016. ""I was Donald Trump before Donald Trump became popular,"" LePage, who spent much of his eight years in office mired in self-created controversies, told a conservative radio host about his backing of Trump. ""So I think I should support him because we're one of the same cloth.""LePage didn't just like Donald Trump the person. He also liked Donald Trump's hotels, too. As governor, LePage spent more than $22,000 from the state budget at Trump properties in his final two years in office. All told, LePage and his administration booked 40 rooms at the Trump International Hotel in Washington -- paying between $362 and $1,100 per room, according to some remarkable reporting in the Portland Press Herald.jQuery(document).onZonesAndDomReady(function () {CNN.INJECTOR.executeFeature(""mailchimp"",false).then(function() {CNN.newsletterSubscriptionCard.init( {""baselist"":""6da287d761"",""activelist"":""a4165679e3"",""action"":""https://bulletin.cnn.com"",""overrideSectionFooter"":false,""articleEmbed"":true,""cardtext"":{""intro"":""CNN's Chris Cillizza cuts through the political spin and tells you what you need to know."",""label"":""nightcap"",""title"":""The Point"",""EUNewsletterLegalText"":""\u003cp>CNN will use the information you’ve provided to send you this Newsletter and use cookies and pixel technology to see which newsletters you open, click through and read so that we can learn over time which content is relevant and interesting to you.

Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.Cillizza: This story seems like it took a very long time. Describe the process -- from when the idea germinated until publication.Read MoreThistle: The idea germinated when we noticed soon after President Trump was elected LePage was making frequent trips to Washington, DC. We first asked for travel receipts for LePage's travel in March 2017. His administration never produced any of the records we asked for beyond a copy of his daily calendar, which wasn't very informative besides showing several private meetings in DC. Cillizza: None of these records came out while LePage was in office. Coincidence?Thistle: We actually did get some records from the State Police while he was in office. The State Police staff the governor's Executive Protection Unit and officers travel with him. While heavily redacted, those records included room service receipts for the restaurant inside the Trump International Hotel. We were able to cross reference other charges like room charges and valet charges and they matched to the penny standard charges for the hotel. LePage's office then confirmed they had stayed at the hotel but still did not release any receipts. Our first story on this ran in July of 2017 but we did not know at that time the extent of the visits to Trump International. The administration of LePage's successor turned over 2,000 pages of receipts after LePage left office. Cillizza: Put the $170,000 spent by LePage in context. How unusual is this?Thistle: The $170,000 is the amount LePage's office spent on all out-of-state travel over the last two years of his final term in office, essentially 2017 and 2018. That figure compares to about $45,000 the previous governor spent on out-of-state travel his last two years in office. LePage spent about $22,000 at the Trump hotel, meals and lodging. The previous governor spent about $9,000 on out-of-state lodging.

Paul LePage was an early and enthusiastic supporter of Donald Trump's presidential bid in 2016. ""I was Donald Trump before Donald Trump became popular,"" LePage, who spent much of his eight years in office mired in self-created controversies, told a conservative radio host about his backing of Trump. ""So I think I should support him because we're one of the same cloth.""LePage didn't just like Donald Trump the person. He also liked Donald Trump's hotels, too. As governor, LePage spent more than $22,000 from the state budget at Trump properties in his final two years in office. All told, LePage and his administration booked 40 rooms at the Trump International Hotel in Washington -- paying between $362 and $1,100 per room, according to some remarkable reporting in the Portland Press Herald.jQuery(document).onZonesAndDomReady(function () {CNN.INJECTOR.executeFeature(""mailchimp"",false).then(function() {CNN.newsletterSubscriptionCard.init( {""baselist"":""6da287d761"",""activelist"":""a4165679e3"",""action"":""https://bulletin.cnn.com"",""overrideSectionFooter"":false,""articleEmbed"":true,""cardtext"":{""intro"":""CNN's Chris Cillizza cuts through the political spin and tells you what you need to know."",""label"":""nightcap"",""title"":""The Point"",""EUNewsletterLegalText"":""\u003cp>CNN will use the information you’ve provided to send you this Newsletter and use cookies and pixel technology to see which newsletters you open, click through and read so that we can learn over time which content is relevant and interesting to you.

Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.Cillizza: This story seems like it took a very long time. Describe the process -- from when the idea germinated until publication.Read MoreThistle: The idea germinated when we noticed soon after President Trump was elected LePage was making frequent trips to Washington, DC. We first asked for travel receipts for LePage's travel in March 2017. His administration never produced any of the records we asked for beyond a copy of his daily calendar, which wasn't very informative besides showing several private meetings in DC. Cillizza: None of these records came out while LePage was in office. Coincidence?Thistle: We actually did get some records from the State Police while he was in office. The State Police staff the governor's Executive Protection Unit and officers travel with him. While heavily redacted, those records included room service receipts for the restaurant inside the Trump International Hotel. We were able to cross reference other charges like room charges and valet charges and they matched to the penny standard charges for the hotel. LePage's office then confirmed they had stayed at the hotel but still did not release any receipts. Our first story on this ran in July of 2017 but we did not know at that time the extent of the visits to Trump International. The administration of LePage's successor turned over 2,000 pages of receipts after LePage left office. Cillizza: Put the $170,000 spent by LePage in context. How unusual is this?Thistle: The $170,000 is the amount LePage's office spent on all out-of-state travel over the last two years of his final term in office, essentially 2017 and 2018. That figure compares to about $45,000 the previous governor spent on out-of-state travel his last two years in office. LePage spent about $22,000 at the Trump hotel, meals and lodging. The previous governor spent about $9,000 on out-of-state lodging.

9,PENN BULLOCK,"Good morning. Venezuela’s opposition plans a dramatic next move, Chinese and Iranian hackers step up anti-U.S. efforts and Facebook is excoriated in a British report. Here’s the latest:Venezuela’s crisis is headed for a climaxThe Trump administration and the Venezuelan opposition have a plan to weaken President Nicolás Maduro: getting desperately needed food and medicine into the country.On Saturday, the two forces are set to unleash an ambitious, coordinated land-and-sea effort to move supplies through Colombia, Brazil and Curaçao and into the hands of thousands of Venezuelans.At a rally in Florida, President Trump contentiously framed the struggle as against socialism broadly. “In Venezuela, and across the Western Hemisphere, socialism is dying and liberty, prosperity and democracy are being reborn,” he said. “We seek a peaceful transition of power, but all options are open.”Ahead: The opposition has not said how it will break past Mr. Maduro’s blockade, saying that releasing plans would allow him to stymie the effort. Some activists have suggested simply smuggling the aid in. Others say protesters from Venezuela could overrun soldiers. Risk: Mr. Maduro has sent troops to the border, and tensions over the aid are high. One analyst warned of the possibility of “a hair-trigger moment.” And embracing Mr. Trump could make the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, look like a U.S. puppet.Chinese and Iranian hackers target U.S. companiesDozens of American corporations and government agencies have been hit by attacks that have been attributed to Iran, according to analysts at the National Security Agency and the private security firm FireEye.Those cyberattacks coincide with a renewed effort by China to steal trade and military secrets from U.S. military contractors and technology companies that include Boeing, General Electric and T-Mobile, according to nine intelligence officials, private security researchers and lawyers familiar with the attacks.Context: Cyberespionage from both Iran and China had cooled under former President Barack Obama, who reached landmark agreements with both in 2015. The attacks spiked again after President Trump opened a trade war with Beijing and reneged on the Iran nuclear deal last year.Anti-Semitism among Yellow Vests prompts French soul-searchingFrance is having a crisis of conscience about its perennial and growing problem of anti-Semitism after Alain Finkielkraut, one of the country’s leading essayists and critics from the right, was mobbed by Yellow Vest protesters near his Paris home over the weekend and assailed with anti-Semitic insults. The son of an Auschwitz survivor, he was told to “Go home to Israel!”Mr. Finkielkraut renounced his support for the Yellow Vest movement last week, attracting the ire of its members. Fueled by economic and class resentments, the protesters have previously given off whiffs of anti-Semitism, with coded conspiracy theories about Jewish influence circulating at the edges of the movement. The police are investigating the invective against Mr. Finkielkraut, who has been accused of prejudice himself over his views on immigration.By the numbers: Episodes of anti-Semitism in France jumped 74 percent last year, to 541, up from 311 in 2017, according to government data. (There has also been an uptick in New York.)In Britain: Seven lawmakers resigned from the Labour Party to become independents, one of them accusing Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, of tolerating anti-Semitism in the party, and others denouncing him for refusing to call for a new referendum on Brexit.Vatican prepares for sex abuse meeting amid widening scandalsDecades after the crisis of clerical sexual abuse of minors first exploded into public view, victims of sexual abuse have arrived in Rome for a landmark meeting Pope Francis is holding with representatives of the world’s bishops’ conferences.The victims will speak of their experiences during evening prayers. Context: The meeting comes as more instances of sexual abuse emerge, including the long-overshadowed abuse of nuns by priests. A Times investigation found that the crisis even goes beyond abuse to the suppression and shaming of homosexual priests. And the Vatican revealed to The Times that it has general guidelines for what to do when clerics break celibacy vows and father children. Some of those children will be at the meeting.Over the weekend: Pope Francis expelled a former cardinal and archbishop of Washington from the priesthood after the church found him guilty of sexually abusing minors and adult seminarians. The former cardinal, Theodore McCarrick, was the first Catholic leader at that level to be defrocked for sexual abuse.In the Southern Baptist church: The largest evangelical denomination in the U.S. announced initial recommendations for addressing revelations of rife sexual abuse in Southern Baptist churches across the country.Here’s what else is happeningFacebook: After an 18-month investigation, a British parliamentary committee issued a scathing report accusing the social media company of breaking data privacy and competition laws. Trump vs. Europe: At a security conference in Munich last week, the rift between Europe and the Trump administration became open, angry and concrete, diplomats and analysts say. Leaders and officials from across the continent, particularly Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, laced into the Trump administration’s foreign policy and warned that U.S. isolationism would embolden Russia and China.Brexit: Wall Street’s biggest banks, including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, are shifting their operations from London to European capitals, reshaping the financial industry across the continent. And Honda said it would close its plant in Swindon, which employs 3,500 workers, by 2021.Yemen: Houthi fighters have left a million unmarked land mines across much of the country, stalling the onslaught of Saudi-backed forces but also killing and maiming civilians.U.S.: A coalition of 16 states, including California and New York, challenged President Trump in court over his plan to use emergency powers to spend billions of dollars on his border wall.Poland: After Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said on Thursday that “the Poles cooperated with the Nazis” in the Holocaust, Poland’s president withdrew on Monday from a trip to Israel that was planned with the leaders of three other East European countries. Kashmir: Militants in the disputed region killed an Indian Army major and at least three other soldiers just days after carrying out a bombing that left more than 40 Indian paramilitary officers dead. The attacks have unleashed jingoism across India and raised the specter of conflict with Pakistan. Transportation: Virgin Hyperloop One, a company based in Los Angeles and partly backed by Sir Richard Branson, is testing a mass transit system that would put passengers in pods speeding through vacuum tubes at more than 600 miles per hour.  While such visions are a distant dream, hyperloop companies have attracted key talent and enthusiastic municipalities.Technology: The founder of the Chinese technology giant Huawei, breaking from the company’s previous silence about U.S. criminal charges against the company and his daughter, a top executive, called the case against her politically motivated.Is the game called “tag,” “tig,” “tick” or “it”?

But real, meaningful relationships thrive when they’re face-to-face. It’s as simple as making time for them.Back Story Puccini’s “Madama Butterfly” is one of the most popular operas ever written. It would have been pretty amazing to be at its premiere, which was given this week in 1904, right?Undoubtedly — because it was one of the great fiascos in opera history.The premiere, at the storied Teatro alla Scala in Milan, was often drowned out by what one critic described as “groans, roars, moos, laughs, bellows, sneers.” The New York Times reported that the opera had been “received rather coldly.”Puccini compared the experience to a lynching. Some believed rivals had organized claques to embarrass him. Others cited the opera’s difficult subject matter: An unsympathetic American naval lieutenant impregnates and abandons a Japanese teenager, later driving her to suicide.After several revisions — including a new remorseful aria to soften the lieutenant — “Butterfly” became a hit. (The challenge in staging it these days has more to do with avoiding Orientalism and cultural appropriation.)And in 2016, La Scala staged the rarely seen original version, in a symbolic act of contrition.Michael Cooper, a Times reporter who covers classical music and dance, wrote today’s Back Story.Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.Check out this page to find a Morning Briefing for your region.
