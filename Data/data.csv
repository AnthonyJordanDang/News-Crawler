1,,"Some governments die from a drip, drip, drip of scandal. Some die from a gusher of it.The scandal that is centred on SNC-Lavalin sure looks like a gusher. The engineering company is one of the most important enterprises in Canada. In the past, it has also allegedly greased the palms of foreign fixers to the tune of more than $150-million in bribes. Now the question is whether the company should face a criminal trial that could destroy it, or more benign treatment involving fines and pledges to do better.None of this is helpful during an election year. And it makes a mockery of Justin Trudeau’s pledges of transparency. What he has discovered is that his government is like any other. It vows to be transparent, until it’s not.The scandal cuts to the core of the Trudeau brand in other ways. Nothing could have symbolized his hopes for reconciliation more effectively than his appointment of an Indigenous woman, Jody Wilson-Raybould, as justice minister and attorney-general. She was a walking billboard for his lofty ambitions, and one of his brightest stars. Now the two are locked in a war of credibility – one that he is losing. So far, she hasn’t said a word about what happened. But she doesn’t have to. Every time Mr. Trudeau has spoken on the issue, he’s done himself more damage.Until more facts emerge – and they will – what we do know already is troubling enough.Ms. Wilson-Raybould allegedly came under heavy pressure by the Prime Minister’s Office to pursue a remediation agreement rather than allow criminal charges against SNC-Lavalin to proceed. The remediation agreement involves heavy fines, but no criminal penalties.The central question in the case is whether she was pressed to do anything contrary to law or ethics.And even if she wasn’t, some people think there’s something awfully fishy about the remediation agreement. The legislation to enact it was buried deep in Mr. Trudeau’s omnibus budget last year – just in time for the SNC-Lavalin case.The country is divided in two camps over the fate of the company. Many people in English-speaking Canada are not sympathetic. They see crony capitalism at work. But Quebeckers think the company has paid enough for its alleged misdeeds. Most people there, including the thinking class, believe the case should be settled by remediation. “If SNC is condemned the consequences will be fatal,” wrote columnist Michel Girard in Le Journal de Montréal. And the common sentiment in Quebec is why make engineers in Canada pay for the sins of departed executives who allegedly handed out bribes in Libya years ago?What all this boils down to is that the then-justice minister may have been pressed to make a legal decision of enormous consequence for reasons that are essentially political. That may explain why Mr. Trudeau demoted his star cabinet minister to veterans affairs – a position generally reserved for novices and others low down in the pecking order. She allegedly didn’t do what the PMO wanted with the SNC-Lavalin case, and so Mr. Trudeau essentially fired her and replaced her with somebody more amenable. That person is David Lametti, who has no attractive identity credentials, but seems to have a more benign view about the fate of SNC-Lavalin.In retrospect, the demotion of Ms. Wilson-Raybould is one of the worst decisions that Mr. Trudeau ever made. It made her into a martyr and the Prime Minister’s people into bullies. Their damage-control efforts this week have looked silly, partisan, and downright juvenile. For example, the Liberals agreed to hold hearings on the SNC-Lavalin affair – but then prevented key players from being invited, including the justice minister or anyone from the Prime Minister’s Office.Meanwhile, the Indigenous community is furious. They are using the shoddy treatment of Ms. Wilson-Raybould to pummel the PM hard. ""Racist and sexist,” the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs protested. Ms. Wilson-Raybould’s father, Bill Wilson, who is a Kwakwaka’wakw hereditary chief, called her treatment “a bloody insult to her and Indians across the country.”As of now, Ms. Raybould controls the stage. Everyone is waiting for her to offer her version of events. Meantime, one of Canada’s biggest and most important companies is twisting in the wind. SNC-Lavalin may end up paying the highest price for this affair, because the optics of pushing for remediation might simply have become too bad for the government to pursue. Mr. Trudeau is also a big loser. His government has been shown to be as politically driven and fallible as any other. I doubt that the public is very shocked. We learned to be cynical a long time ago. ​",2019-02-15T21:19:08Z,The Globe And Mail,A perfect storm for Justin Trudeau - The Globe and Mail,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-a-perfect-storm-for-justin-trudeau/
2,Grace Dobush,"When he was first elected as Canada’s prime minister in 2015, Justin Trudeau promised openness, accountability and transparency in politics. In just one month, that reputation has been all but lost.
Trudeau, the son of 16-year former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, has a lot going for him: Canada has the lowest levels of unemployment in 40 years, the fastest growing wages in a decade and the lowest debt-to-GDP ratio among the G7 nations.
But the current political scandal, in which Trudeau is accused of meddling in a federal criminal investigation, is tearing his cabinet apart as opposition leaders call for his resignation.
What’s going on, exactly?
Trudeau and his top aides are accused of pressuring Jody Wilson-Raybould, then Canadian attorney general and justice minister, to go easy on the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin (sncaf), a major Canadian engineering firm.


Wilson-Raybould said senior government officials, mostly from Trudeau’s office, pressured her to order prosecutors to cut a plea deal with SNC-Lavalin, which is based in Montreal in the politically important province of Quebec.
She added that Trudeau said a solution must be found because otherwise many jobs could be lost, and SNC-Lavalin could move its headquarters from Montreal to London.
At the same time a plea deal in the fraud and corruption case would have allowed SNC-Lavalin to avoid a decade-long ban on bidding on government contracts in Canada, which make up a significant portion of the company’s revenue.
In response, Wilson-Raybould said she wasn’t going to interfere in a decision by prosecutors to not pursue a plea deal. She then resigned from her justice posts in January and became minister of veterans affairs, before resigning from the Cabinet altogether in February. Toronto’s Globe and Mail first reported on the scandal at the beginning of February.

“I experienced a consistent and sustained effort by many people within the government to seek to politically interfere in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion,” Wilson-Raybould testified before a parliamentary committee at the end of February, the Wall Street Journal reports.
What are the charges against SNC-Lavalin?
Canadian prosecutors filed corruption and fraud charges against SNC-Lavalin, which employs 50,000 workers worldwide, in 2015 related to activity in Libya from 2001 to 2011. Its officials are accused of bribing Libyan officials under Muammar Qaddafi with C$48 million to secure contracts there. Back home in Canada, a former CEO pleaded guilty this month to charges related to a bribery scandal involving the construction of a Montreal hospital.
What does Trudeau say?
Trudeau has not denied that he and aides spoke to Wilson-Raybould about the SNC-Lavalin case, the Guardian reports, but claims their discussions were within the bounds of the rules.


At a Liberal Party rally on Monday, per the New York Times, Trudeau said, “I know that Ms. Philpott has felt this way for some time. While I’m disappointed, I understand her decision.” He added that the political controversy “has generated important discussion” and said, “there are more questions to be answered and more to be said in the coming days and weeks.”
What’s happening now?
Canada’s Ethics Commissioner launched a federal investigation into the alleged interference on February 11. Gerald Butts, Trudeau’s closest adviser and a longtime friend, resigned on February 18 and is scheduled to testify before a parliamentary committee on Wednesday.
In a new development, Treasury Board President Jane Philpott —once one of Trudeau’s closest allies — resigned on Monday, saying she had lost confidence in the government.

There can be a cost to acting on one’s principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them. pic.twitter.com/EwO5dtdgG6

Will this affect Trudeau’s chances in the 2019 election?
Trudeau is up for re-election in October. He needs to carry Quebec to win, and SNC-Lavalin’s potential loss of jobs there would have been a blow to his chances. WSJ reports that polling since the scandal emerged indicates Trudeau and the Liberal government are bleeding support and the opposition Conservatives are holding a lead. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer repeated his call for Trudeau to step down on Monday.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian government, as expected, on Friday approved extradition proceedings against the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, prompting a furious reaction from China.  Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was detained in Vancouver last December and is under house arrest. In late January the U.S. Justice Department charged Meng and Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.  Meng will appear in a Vancouver court at 10 a.m. Pacific time (1800 GMT) on March 6, when a date will be set for her extradition hearing.  ""Today, department of Justice Canada officials issued an authority to proceed, formally commencing an extradition process in the case of Ms. Meng Wanzhou,"" the government said in a statement.  China, whose relations with Canada have deteriorated badly over the affair, denounced the decision and repeated previous demands for Meng's release.  Legal experts had predicted the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau would give the go-ahead for extradition proceedings, given the close judicial relationship between Canada and the United States.  It could be years though before Meng is ever sent to the United States, since Canada's slow-moving justice system allows many decisions to be appealed.                                                                                                              A final decision will likely come down to the federal justice minister, who will face the choice of angering the United States by rejecting the extradition bid, or China by accepting it.

""I suspect the Trudeau government is desperately hoping that the Americans reach a deal with the Chinese,"" he said by phone.                                                                                                              U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters in December he would intervene if it served national security interests or helped close a trade deal with China, prompting Ottawa to stress the extradition process should not be politicized. Last week Trump played down the idea of dropping the charges.  After Meng's detention, China arrested two Canadians on national security grounds, and a Chinese court later sentenced to death a Canadian man who previously had only been jailed for drug smuggling.  Brock University professor Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat who had served two postings in China, said Beijing was likely to retaliate further.  ""They're not going to take this lying down ... one shudders to think what the consequences could be,"" he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp, saying Beijing might crack down on Canadian canola shipments or stop Chinese students from going to Canada.                                                                                                              Ottawa rejects Chinese calls to release Meng, saying it cannot interfere with the judiciary.  ""The Chinese side is utterly dissatisfied with and firmly opposes the issuance of (the) authority to proceed,"" the embassy in Ottawa said in a statement.  Beijing had earlier questioned the state of judicial independence in Canada, noting the government faces accusations it had tried to intervene to stop a corruption trial.  Canadian Justice Minister David Lametti declined to comment.                                                                                                              Huawei was not immediately available for comment.  Meng's lawyers said they were disappointed and described the U.S. charges as politically motivated.

Not ratifying NAFTA will be a 'catastrophe,' U.S. trade czar says, as U.S. works to lift metals tariffs







Deal nears for end to U.S. metal tariffs, but Trump’s push to impose strict steel quotas could create fresh tensions













OTTAWA — Canada and Mexico are dealing with lingering hard feelings over last summer’s surprise Mexican trade deal with the United States as their new continental trade pact awaits a final stamp of political approval.Two weeks ago, the head of a visiting delegation of Canadian parliamentarians told the newly installed Mexican foreign minister his country threw Canada “under the bus” last August when it forged a bilateral trade deal with the United States during the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.A top Mexican trade official tells The Canadian Press that while there may have been a misunderstanding, the U.S. side deal was the work of the previous Mexican government, and Canada and Mexico’s new leaders are moving forward constructively.  Not ratifying NAFTA will be a ‘catastrophe,’ U.S. trade czar says, as U.S. works to lift metals tariffs Half of Canadian executives say old NAFTA better for our economy than USMCA Canada won’t ratify new NAFTA until steel and aluminum tariffs lifted, warns key U.S. Senator The side deal between the U.S. and Mexico appeared to blindside the Trudeau government, forcing Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland to abort a three-country trip to Europe.Canada and U.S. negotiators reached an 11th-hour agreement that was signed two months later on Nov. 30 by the country’s three leaders — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, President Donald Trump and former Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto, who was on his last official day in office.The deal must now be ratified by the legislatures of all three countries, but with turmoil in Washington, and a slowly-shuttering political window in Ottawa with a fall federal election on the horizon, that is far from certain.Moreover, Canada and Mexico insist the Trump administration will have to lift its punishing tariffs on their steel and aluminum exports, which the mercurial president imposed under a controversial national security clause in U.S. trade law both countries say was illegal.Canadian and Mexican politicians have been holding a series of regular meetings and exchanges, including a two-day session of parliamentarians in Ottawa this week, and a gathering of the ParlAmericas group, a network of legislators from 35 Western Hemisphere countries, earlier this month.The head of Canadian ParlAmericas chapter, Liberal MP Bob Nault, expressed Canada’s dissatisfaction about last August’s Mexican side deal with the country’s new foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, during the organization’s Mexico City meeting earlier this month.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

“We did say very clearly in our last meeting in Mexico with the foreign affairs minister that we were frustrated with the feeling that Mexico was sort of moving away from the trilateral agreement,” Nault said in an interview.Nault said he was concerned about “the way it unfolded at the end,” and a perception “that Canada got thrown under the bus by Mexico.” He said that represented a break from “what we originally felt was the approach, that is, Mexico and Canada had to be very close to each other to make sure we got a good deal for our countries and make sure the U.S. didn’t overtake us.”The Canadian Press has previously reported, citing anonymous sources, that Freeland gave Mexican negotiators an upbraiding over their bilateral deal during an August meeting in Washington.“I think it’s getting better,” Nault said this week of the relationship. “Overall, we both have the same position: we want the tariffs removed. We want them removed now. We want to move forward with ratification.”Luz Maria de la Mora, Mexico’s deputy trade minister, acknowledged the past Canadian complaints, but she said the two countries are moving forward constructively.“That was part of the negotiation process … right now, it’s over,” de la Mora said in an interview.“The previous administration in Mexico was responsible for doing that. But at the end of the day, it might have been the case that it actually helped the process.”The Mexico-U.S. side deal marked the start of nearly two months of intense talks between Canadian and American negotiators because the Trump administration imposed a Sept. 30 deadline for Canada to sign on to the U.S.-Mexico pact or potentially be cast adrift.De la Mora succeeded Juan Carlos Baker, one of Mexico’s top negotiators, when the new Mexican government of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was sworn in on Dec. 1.Lopez Obrador won the Mexican presidency in July, branding himself a socialist reformer dedicated to ending decades of corruption and improving the plight of Mexican workers. His term didn’t begin until Dec. 1, which left a window for the Pena Nieto government to finish negotiating a trade deal that Lopez Obrador would have to sell to his country’s lawmakers.During the transition, members of Lopez Obrador’s team joined the Mexican negotiators, but de la Mora said they acted as observers, not participants. She said that extended to the Mexican decision to move forward with a bilateral deal with Canada.“We were not involved in that decision at all,” de la Mora said.“If at some point during the negotiations there were misunderstandings or miscommunications, those moments are over.”She cited the fact that half a dozen of her cabinet colleagues visited Ottawa in November before they were sworn in, in order to forge a good working relationship.“It would be very positive that the three countries have this agreement approved this year, really. It would be something that would send a really good signal to the markets.”

Sign in to CommentOTTAWA — Canada and Mexico are dealing with lingering hard feelings over last summer’s surprise Mexican trade deal with the United States as their new continental trade pact awaits a final stamp of political approval.Two weeks ago, the head of a visiting delegation of Canadian parliamentarians told the newly installed Mexican foreign minister his country threw Canada “under the bus” last August when it forged a bilateral trade deal with the United States during the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.A top Mexican trade official tells The Canadian Press that while there may have been a misunderstanding, the U.S. side deal was the work of the previous Mexican government, and Canada and Mexico’s new leaders are moving forward constructively.  Not ratifying NAFTA will be a ‘catastrophe,’ U.S. trade czar says, as U.S. works to lift metals tariffs Half of Canadian executives say old NAFTA better for our economy than USMCA Canada won’t ratify new NAFTA until steel and aluminum tariffs lifted, warns key U.S. Senator The side deal between the U.S. and Mexico appeared to blindside the Trudeau government, forcing Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland to abort a three-country trip to Europe.Canada and U.S. negotiators reached an 11th-hour agreement that was signed two months later on Nov. 30 by the country’s three leaders — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, President Donald Trump and former Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto, who was on his last official day in office.The deal must now be ratified by the legislatures of all three countries, but with turmoil in Washington, and a slowly-shuttering political window in Ottawa with a fall federal election on the horizon, that is far from certain.Moreover, Canada and Mexico insist the Trump administration will have to lift its punishing tariffs on their steel and aluminum exports, which the mercurial president imposed under a controversial national security clause in U.S. trade law both countries say was illegal.Canadian and Mexican politicians have been holding a series of regular meetings and exchanges, including a two-day session of parliamentarians in Ottawa this week, and a gathering of the ParlAmericas group, a network of legislators from 35 Western Hemisphere countries, earlier this month.The head of Canadian ParlAmericas chapter, Liberal MP Bob Nault, expressed Canada’s dissatisfaction about last August’s Mexican side deal with the country’s new foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, during the organization’s Mexico City meeting earlier this month.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

“We did say very clearly in our last meeting in Mexico with the foreign affairs minister that we were frustrated with the feeling that Mexico was sort of moving away from the trilateral agreement,” Nault said in an interview.Nault said he was concerned about “the way it unfolded at the end,” and a perception “that Canada got thrown under the bus by Mexico.” He said that represented a break from “what we originally felt was the approach, that is, Mexico and Canada had to be very close to each other to make sure we got a good deal for our countries and make sure the U.S. didn’t overtake us.”The Canadian Press has previously reported, citing anonymous sources, that Freeland gave Mexican negotiators an upbraiding over their bilateral deal during an August meeting in Washington.“I think it’s getting better,” Nault said this week of the relationship. “Overall, we both have the same position: we want the tariffs removed. We want them removed now. We want to move forward with ratification.”Luz Maria de la Mora, Mexico’s deputy trade minister, acknowledged the past Canadian complaints, but she said the two countries are moving forward constructively.“That was part of the negotiation process … right now, it’s over,” de la Mora said in an interview.“The previous administration in Mexico was responsible for doing that. But at the end of the day, it might have been the case that it actually helped the process.”The Mexico-U.S. side deal marked the start of nearly two months of intense talks between Canadian and American negotiators because the Trump administration imposed a Sept. 30 deadline for Canada to sign on to the U.S.-Mexico pact or potentially be cast adrift.De la Mora succeeded Juan Carlos Baker, one of Mexico’s top negotiators, when the new Mexican government of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was sworn in on Dec. 1.Lopez Obrador won the Mexican presidency in July, branding himself a socialist reformer dedicated to ending decades of corruption and improving the plight of Mexican workers. His term didn’t begin until Dec. 1, which left a window for the Pena Nieto government to finish negotiating a trade deal that Lopez Obrador would have to sell to his country’s lawmakers.During the transition, members of Lopez Obrador’s team joined the Mexican negotiators, but de la Mora said they acted as observers, not participants. She said that extended to the Mexican decision to move forward with a bilateral deal with Canada.“We were not involved in that decision at all,” de la Mora said.“If at some point during the negotiations there were misunderstandings or miscommunications, those moments are over.”She cited the fact that half a dozen of her cabinet colleagues visited Ottawa in November before they were sworn in, in order to forge a good working relationship.“It would be very positive that the three countries have this agreement approved this year, really. It would be something that would send a really good signal to the markets.”",2019-02-28T16:32:06Z,Financial Post,"Mexico threw Canada ‘under the bus’ with bilateral trade deal with U.S., Liberal MP tells Mexican minister",https://business.financialpost.com/news/economy/mexico-threw-canada-under-the-bus-liberal-mp-tells-mexican-minister
6,Ned Ryun,"closeVideoIs controversy over Rep. Ilhan Omar threatening Democratic unity?Freshman Congresswoman Katie Hill, Democratic member of the House Oversight Committee, shares insight on 'Fox News Sunday.'If you are shocked at the Democratic Party’s timid response to Rep. Ilhan Omar’s numerous anti-Semitic remarks, you shouldn’t be. It just means you haven’t been following Democratic politics, and more specifically, progressive politics, the last few years. This is the end result of a party that has become infected by the Boycott, Divestment and Sanction (BDS) movement targeting the state of Israel’s right to exist, and the progressive movement that has embraced the absurdity of intersectionality and moral equivalency.There is a reason that Nancy Pelosi lacks the courage to forcefully denounce Omar’s rhetoric, and lacks the will to remove her from the Foreign Affairs committee, as the GOP did to one of its own who engaged in racist rhetoric. It’s called the politics of self-preservation and expediency.ILHAN OMAR IS AN ANTI-SEMITE WHO BRANDS CRITICISM OF HER AS ANTI-MUSLIM BIGOTRY - BUT SHE'S THE REAL BIGOTA not insignificant amount of the progressive base, the small donor base, and grassroots workers of the Democratic Party adhere to the BDS movement. This movement is not simply a movement that disagrees with some of Israel’s policies. It is a militant anti-Semitic movement that ultimately seeks to bring down the state of Israel.  No other state is targeted the way Israel is, and it is targeted because it is a Jewish state.  Apparently Muslim states are fine with the BDS movement, but a Jewish state is not.Some argue that you can disagree with the state of Israel and not be anti-Semitic. Of course. That’s like stating the obvious to the simple-minded: you can disagree with much of what the American government is doing and not be un-American. That’s not the point. The point is that when you deny Israel's right to exist as a democratic Jewish state, when you demonize Israel and attempt to delegitimize it, when you use anti-Semitic rhetoric and tropes used by the Nazis, you really are ultimately denying the right of the Jewish people to protect themselves from future genocide. Period. Full stop.There is something insidious to all of this: the BDS movement has made it acceptable to many on the left to accept anti-Semitism as somewhat normal. BDS really is the gateway drug to anti-Semitism. All one must do is look to college campuses, where the BDS movement has gained a significant foothold. When you hear students and professors call out “Gas them, burn them and dismantle their power structure. Humanity cannot progress with the parasitic Jew,” you would be forgiven if you thought you were reading Nazi propaganda. You were not. You were reading a comment made on the anonymous Yik Yak app by someone at the University of Chicago regarding the passage of a BDS motion on the Northwestern campus.What is clear is that while anti-Semitism is sadly on all sides of the political spectrum in this country, it is only on the left that people advocating anti-Semitism have gained positions of power.This is a problem not only in the United States, but across the world as well: in January of this year, Justin Trudeau came out forcefully against the BDS movement in Canada, calling it “anti-Semitic and contrary to ‘Canadian values’” and followed up by “accusing it of intimidating Jewish students on university campuses.”What is clear is that while anti-Semitism is sadly on all sides of the political spectrum in this country, it is only on the left that people advocating anti-Semitism have gained positions of power – like, say, an anti-Semite gaining a position on the House Foreign Affairs committee. By not forcefully condemning Omar’s anti-Semitism, by allowing her to stay on Foreign Affairs, by not condemning the BDS movement, the Democratic Party is helping mainstream anti-Semitism. What is troubling for students of history, of which it appears many on the left are not, is that the real secret to Hitler’s rise to power and acceptance of his politics was making anti-Semitism acceptable among the “polite middle class” in Germany.But at least many Americans still find this unbelievable that a major political party in the United States lacks the courage to name the offender and denounce her comments. It is still unbelievable that not too long ago, the overwhelming majority of Americans, regardless of party affiliation, would have stated loud and definitively, “Never again!” But now, confronted with the worldview of Omar, the Democratic response has been, “It’s not that bad.”Further weakening the Democrats’ ability to forcefully condemn Omar is the party’s acceptance of intersectionality and moral equivalency.  When you claim that every worldview is equally good and acceptable (but you really mean to denounce anything Western), and when you justify anti-Semitism because Omar previously lived in and escaped from persecution in another country, and that her life experience and demographic make her a victim, you lack the ability to definitively denounce such things as anti-Semitism.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTake for example one of the most staggering statements by Democratic leadership, made by majority whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., regarding Omar. He said her experience “is much more empirical -- and powerful -- than that of people who are generations removed from the Holocaust, Japanese internment camps during WWII and the other violent episodes that have marked history.” And there you have it. In the process of telling the Jewish people to check their privilege, Clyburn somehow believes that Omar’s experiences as a Somali refugee are the moral equivalent – actually a morally superior position – to the horror of murdering of six million Jewish people.  Rep. Clyburn forgets that Holocaust survivors are still with us, as are their children: one of them sits in the Congress in his caucus.That, my friends, is how far the Democratic Party has fallen. It is tolerating itself to death. It’s become clear that the Democratic Party has become the party of infanticide, socialism and anti-Semitism; in short, a moral cesspool. In its current iteration, it deserves to be deserted in droves by voters.

7,Yuliya Talmazan and Associated Press and Reuters,"Breaking News EmailsGet breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.SUBSCRIBEMarch 6, 2019, 11:57 AM GMT / Updated March 6, 2019, 12:20 PM GMTBy Yuliya TalmazanWhen Justin Trudeau was elected Canadian prime minister four years ago, he became an instant international celebrity and media darling.The charismatic and photogenic politician made headlines for everything from his feminist views to his tattoos and past jobs — which include being a bungee-jumping coach.While his father, Pierre Trudeau, governed the country for the vast majority of 1968 until 1984, the chances of Justin Trudeau winning a second term this year appear to be dimming amid the biggest crisis of his political career. The scandal has already cost Trudeau his top aide and best friend, as well two of his highest-profile female Cabinet ministers.Here is a look at what happened — and what might happen next.What is at the heart of the scandal?In a serious blow to Trudeau, 47, a second member of his Cabinet resigned on Monday, saying she had lost confidence in how his Liberal government had dealt with a scandal that has dominated the news for nearly a month.Treasury Board President Jane Philpott, in overall charge of government spending, expressed her unhappiness about the government's response to allegations that former Justice Minister and Attorney General Jody Wilson-Raybould was inappropriately pressured to avoid the criminal prosecution of a major engineering company.It grieves me to resign from a portfolio where I was at work to deliver an important mandate. I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities, constitutional obligations. There can be a cost to acting on one’s principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them. pic.twitter.com/EwO5dtdgG6— Jane Philpott (@janephilpott) March 4, 2019 Critics say there may have been improper political meddling in a criminal case.Philpott is a close friend of Wilson-Raybould, who resigned on Feb. 12 after she was unexpectedly demoted the previous month.Wilson-Raybould said last week she was convinced that her refusal to help Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin — the firm accused of paying bribes for government contracts in Libya — was behind the demotion.She testified that Trudeau and senior members of his government pushed an option that would include SNC-Lavalin paying reparations but avoiding a trial. However, Wilson-Raybould also said she did not think any laws had been broken.""The man who said in 2015 he wanted to change politics is increasingly seen as a politician like any other.""If convicted, SNC-Lavalin would be banned from receiving any federal government business for a decade. The company is a major employer in Quebec, with about 3,400 employees in the province, 9,000 employees in Canada and more than 50,000 worldwide.Wilson-Raybould testified that Trudeau, who represents part of Quebec, had expressed concerns about those jobs being lost.Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau congratulates Jane Philpott after she was sworn-in as Canada's minister of indigenous services in 2017.Chris Wattie / Reuters fileGerald Butts, Trudeau’s closest adviser and a longtime friend, also resigned last week. He denied that he or anyone in the Trudeau's office pressured Wilson-Raybould and is due to provide a rebuttal to her testimony at a parliamentary justice committee Wednesday.Lori Turnbull, the director of the School of Public Administration at Canada’s Dalhousie University, wrote in The Globe and Mail that Philpott’s resignation from the Cabinet was “nothing short of catastrophic for the government.”“Philpott did not mince words,” Turnbull wrote. “She does not want to resign but she has to, given the moral space between her and the government.”Why is the latest resignation so damaging?Philpott, 58, was widely regarded as one of the most respected and competent ministers in Trudeau's government.A physician by trade, she previously served as minister of health and minister of indigenous services.Philpott said the alleged efforts by politicians and officials to pressure Wilson-Raybould had raised serious concerns and she quit in solidarity with her.Lori Williams, an associate professor in the Department of Economics, Justice and Policy Studies at Mount Royal University in Calgary, said Philpott's ""principled resignation"" was a ""significant blow"" for Trudeau.""She was one of the government’s most effective advocates, and she resigned because she no longer felt she could defend all her government has done,"" Williams said.Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau addresses lawmakers last month.Chris Wattie / Reuters fileDaniel Beland, a political science professor and director of McGill Institute for the Study of Canada in Montreal, said Philpott's decision hit Trudeau ""especially hard"" because her resignation letter was a ""strong rebuttal of the prime minister.""Trudeau, the self-proclaimed feminist, had promised accountability in politics and a gender-balanced Cabinet when he took power in 2015.“Two influential and well-regarded women have now left the Cabinet in the name of broad principles such as the rule of law,"" Beland added. ""This doesn’t look good for Trudeau.""“It turns out women really aren’t just like men, and aren’t necessarily afraid to stand by their beliefs,"" National Post columnist Kelly McParland wrote on Tuesday.How are other politicians reacting?Multiple Canadian media outlets reported Tuesday that all of Trudeau's 33 remaining Cabinet ministers said they still have confidence in the prime minister, but there are signs of discord.Wayne Long, a lawmaker in Trudeau's Liberal Party, said he was ""deeply troubled"" by Philpott's departure and called for a “full and transparent” investigation into the matter.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks during Question Period in Canada's House of Commons on Feb. 27.Chris Wattie / ReutersCelina Caesar-Chavannes, a Liberal lawmaker who is not seeking re-election in October, tweeted: ""When you add women, please do not expect the status quo. Expect us to make correct decisions, stand for what is right and exit when values are compromised.""Andrew Scheer, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, has called for Trudeau to resign and said Philpott's resignation demonstrates ""a government in total chaos.” He also wants police to look into what happened.Could Trudeau be ousted?Beland, the professor, doesn’t think Trudeau’s Liberals will try to depose him.“Changing the prime minister is quite unlikely unless new and powerful evidence surfaces about the SNC-Lavalin file,” Beland said.“The next federal elections are coming fast and there’s no obvious heir apparent within the Liberal Cabinet. Right now, most Liberals probably think Trudeau remains their best bet to win the next federal election.”What will Trudeau do?Analysts believe Trudeau will try to ride out the storm.“There is absolutely no chance Trudeau will resign,"" said Nelson Wiseman, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto. ""The Liberals will rally around him.""Williams, the Mount Royal University academic, said Trudeau could potentially argue that ""his motive was legitimate — protecting Canadian jobs.""But Beland said Trudeau had mishandled the affair, damaged his family's brand and had provided plenty of ammunition for opponents.“The man who said in 2015 he wanted to change politics is increasingly seen as a politician like any other,” he said. “He might still find a way to remain prime minister after the October election, but his public image is forever tarnished.”Yuliya TalmazanYuliya Talmazan is a London-based journalist.Associated Press and Reuters contributed.",2019-03-06T12:00:35Z,NBC News,Justin Trudeau vowed to change politics.

in corruption scandal  02:20 (CNN)A second high-profile minister has resigned from the cabinet of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau,  amid a corruption scandal that threatens to destabilize his government ahead of this year's national election. Jane Philpott, who had held several portfolios in Trudeau's cabinet before becoming treasury board president, announced her decision to leave Monday. In a tweet she said had lost confidence in the government's handling of an inquiry into allegations that officials linked to Trudeau had pressured a former minister to help Quebec-based construction company SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution. ""The solemn principles at stake are the independence and integrity of our justice system.... Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised,"" she said in her resignation letter.""There can be a cost to acting on one's principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.""Read MoreWith her resignation she joins Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former minister of justice and attorney general, and Gerald Butts, Trudeau's former top aide, in stepping down.Wilson-Raybould initially brought the firestorm around Trudeau's government, alleging in testimony to the House Justice Committee in February that she faced ""veiled threats"" and ""sustained"" pressure from government officials to intervene in a corruption and fraud case against SNC-Lavalin, one of the world's largest construction and engineering companies. Second cabinet minister to resignOn Monday, Trudeau thanked his former cabinet secretary for her service, and said that the growing scandal had opened a critical window on the country's political institutions. ""In a democracy like ours, and in a space where we value our diversity so strongly, we're allowed to have disagreements and debate. We even encourage it,"" he told a crowd at the Liberal Climate Action Rally in Toronto. ""This matter has generated an important discussion -- how democratic institutions, specifically the federal ministry, and the staff and officials who support it, conduct themselves. It is critical and core to all of our principles.""China reveals case against two Canadians detained in wake of Huawei arrestThe scandal now threatens to engulf Trudeau's Liberal party ahead of elections scheduled to take place before October this year. The leader of the opposition Conservatives, Andrew Scheer, said that Philpott's resignation ""clearly demonstrates a government in total chaos led by a disgraced prime minister,"" according to CNN affiliate CTV, calling on other cabinet ministers to either resign or demand Trudeau step down. ""Is this what you got into politics for?"" he asked, in a press conference. ""If not, it's time for them to stand up and be heard, like Jane Philpott did today.""NPD leader Jagmeet Singh also capitalized on Philpott's move as well, tweeting that her resignation ""underscores the need for a public inquiry (into the SNC-Lavalin scandal) now more than ever"" and ""raises serious questions about PM Trudeau's interference... Canadians deserve a government on their side.""His party is calling for Trudeau to testify under oath about the SNC-Lavalin scandal, CTV reports.Pressure from overseasThe controversy comes at an unfortunate time for Trudeau, who is currently facing a full-blown diplomatic crisis with China following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.Meng is the Chinese technology company's chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei. At the request of the US, Canada detained her on December 1 to face possible extradition to the US over charges of breaking Iran sanctions.Beijing has labeled her arrest a political decision and demanded her immediate release. Shortly after Meng was arrested in Canada, two Canadians in China were detained and now are facing serious charges of spying. Another Canadian man, imprisoned on drug charges, was rapidly retried in January and sentenced to death.In a statement Monday, Trudeau said he was ""obviously very concerned with this position that China has taken.""Content by CompareCardsTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until 2020 Getting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent credit 9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 2021 Spend $500, Get $150 with this astonishing new credit card The fastest way to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt Content by LendingTree30 yr fixed rates just declined.

in corruption scandal  02:20JUST WATCHEDJustin Trudeau engulfed in corruption scandal ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH(CNN)A second high-profile minister has resigned from the cabinet of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau,  amid a corruption scandal that threatens to destabilize his government ahead of this year's national election. Jane Philpott, who had held several portfolios in Trudeau's cabinet before becoming treasury board president, announced her decision to leave Monday. In a tweet she said had lost confidence in the government's handling of an inquiry into allegations that officials linked to Trudeau had pressured a former minister to help Quebec-based construction company SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution. ""The solemn principles at stake are the independence and integrity of our justice system.... Sadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and in how it has responded to the issues raised,"" she said in her resignation letter.""There can be a cost to acting on one's principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.""Read MoreWith her resignation she joins Jody Wilson-Raybould, the former minister of justice and attorney general, and Gerald Butts, Trudeau's former top aide, in stepping down.Wilson-Raybould initially brought the firestorm around Trudeau's government, alleging in testimony to the House Justice Committee in February that she faced ""veiled threats"" and ""sustained"" pressure from government officials to intervene in a corruption and fraud case against SNC-Lavalin, one of the world's largest construction and engineering companies. Second cabinet minister to resignOn Monday, Trudeau thanked his former cabinet secretary for her service, and said that the growing scandal had opened a critical window on the country's political institutions. ""In a democracy like ours, and in a space where we value our diversity so strongly, we're allowed to have disagreements and debate. We even encourage it,"" he told a crowd at the Liberal Climate Action Rally in Toronto. ""This matter has generated an important discussion -- how democratic institutions, specifically the federal ministry, and the staff and officials who support it, conduct themselves. It is critical and core to all of our principles.""China reveals case against two Canadians detained in wake of Huawei arrestThe scandal now threatens to engulf Trudeau's Liberal party ahead of elections scheduled to take place before October this year. The leader of the opposition Conservatives, Andrew Scheer, said that Philpott's resignation ""clearly demonstrates a government in total chaos led by a disgraced prime minister,"" according to CNN affiliate CTV, calling on other cabinet ministers to either resign or demand Trudeau step down. ""Is this what you got into politics for?"" he asked, in a press conference. ""If not, it's time for them to stand up and be heard, like Jane Philpott did today.""NPD leader Jagmeet Singh also capitalized on Philpott's move as well, tweeting that her resignation ""underscores the need for a public inquiry (into the SNC-Lavalin scandal) now more than ever"" and ""raises serious questions about PM Trudeau's interference... Canadians deserve a government on their side.""His party is calling for Trudeau to testify under oath about the SNC-Lavalin scandal, CTV reports.Pressure from overseasThe controversy comes at an unfortunate time for Trudeau, who is currently facing a full-blown diplomatic crisis with China following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.Meng is the Chinese technology company's chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei. At the request of the US, Canada detained her on December 1 to face possible extradition to the US over charges of breaking Iran sanctions.Beijing has labeled her arrest a political decision and demanded her immediate release. Shortly after Meng was arrested in Canada, two Canadians in China were detained and now are facing serious charges of spying. Another Canadian man, imprisoned on drug charges, was rapidly retried in January and sentenced to death.In a statement Monday, Trudeau said he was ""obviously very concerned with this position that China has taken.""Content by CompareCardsTransfer your debt to a card with 0% interest until 2020 Getting approved for 1 of these cards means you have excellent credit 9 cards charging 0% interest until nearly 2021 Spend $500, Get $150 with this astonishing new credit card The fastest way to pay off $10,000 in credit card debt Content by LendingTree30 yr fixed rates just declined.

9,THE EDITORIAL BOARD,"Justin Trudeau came to office in 2015 by the high road, exuding charm, confidence, integrity and an openness to change. He filled his cabinet with women and minorities, opened Canada’s doors to immigrants and posed for endless selfies with adoring crowds. But in politics the fresher the face, the more obvious the blemishes.With seven months to go before Canada’s next national election, the prime minister is embroiled in a political scandal that his charm cannot wipe away. Two members of his cabinet, both prominent women, have resigned, as has his closest adviser, and unless he can convince the public — and do so soon — that he really did nothing wrong in trying to head off the criminal prosecution of a big Montreal-based company, the damage will only get more serious.The crisis unfolded after The Globe and Mail newspaper reported on Feb. 7 that Jody Wilson-Raybould, Mr. Trudeau’s former justice minister and attorney general, had come under improper pressure from the prime minister’s office to reach a negotiated settlement with a multinational engineering firm, SNC-Lavalin, instead of prosecuting it on criminal charges it faces over its business dealings in Libya. Conviction would bar it from government contracts for a decade.The case centers on accusations that SNC-Lavalin paid 47.7 million Canadian dollars in bribes to officials in Libya to win contracts there, and defrauded the Libyan government and its agencies of 129.8 million Canadian dollars. Libya at the time was led by the dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.In the fallout that followed, Ms. Wilson-Raybould resigned from the cabinet, and in testimony to a parliamentary committee last week she described how Mr. Trudeau and his staff had pressed her not to prosecute the firm, citing the company’s threat to slash thousands of jobs or leave Canada entirely. Mr. Trudeau reportedly told her that the loss of those jobs would hurt the ruling Liberal Party in future elections. Of course, companies facing litigation, taxation or other costs of doing business often make such threats.Then on Monday another high-profile government minister, Jane Philpott, abruptly resigned as president of the Treasury Board, saying she had lost confidence in the Trudeau government’s handling of the affair. “I must abide by my core values, my ethical responsibilities and constitutional obligations,” Ms. Philpott said in a letter to the prime minister. “There can be a cost to acting on one’s principles, but there is a bigger cost to abandoning them.”All along, Mr. Trudeau has denied doing anything wrong. He acknowledges that he spoke to Ms. Wilson-Raybould about the SNC-Lavalin case but argues that the discussions were well within the bounds of the rules. His defenders note that charges were not dropped against the company and that a prime minister should show concern about the potential loss of 9,000 jobs. The issue, moreover, was never about dropping charges, but about allowing the firm to pay a fine instead of facing a criminal prosecution.Looked at from south of the Canadian border, the entire matter may seem trivial alongside any of the many accusations levied at President Trump, or of the pressures routinely applied by politicians on behalf of powerful companies.But in Canada, the tangled SNC-Lavalin affair is unavoidably measured against the expectations Mr. Trudeau raised and the standards he set. For him to be accused by two prominent women from his team of violating the high ethical bar he himself set is a major blow, at the least to his brand.Mr. Trudeau is not likely to be compelled to resign over the issue. But the degree of political damage he sustains, and how the scandal affects the October elections, depend on whether he can convince Canadians, in an open venue and in detail, that he did no wrong.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.
